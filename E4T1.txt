Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

1) Make modification to WebappSG by removing All traffic rule on 0.0.0.0/0.
2) Allow access on port 5000 only through public subnet of ALB not to 0.0.0.0/0
3) Also if possible control the SSH to specific subnet range.

Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?
Answer:- Current Instance role has resource and action as "*" which allows access to all the bucket under account. Instead of that we control the access to read/List on the files under the specific bucket to specific resource.
