1) Identify tools that will allow you to do the following: 
a. Scan infrastructure as code templates.   
Answer :- Regula/Terafform Scan

b. Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities.
Answer :- AWS config/AWS inspector/Cloud Trail

c. Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities.
Answer :- AWS security Hub,AWS GuardDuty

2) For each tool - identify an example compliance violation or vulnerability which it might expose.
Answer 
 
 1) Regula :- API key's in code OR IAM policies should not have full administrative privileges OR IAM policies should not be attached directly to users
 2) AWS Config/AWS inspector:- SGGroup for port scanning or vulnerabilities scan on EC2
 Example 
AWS Config 
Example 
cand-c3-secret-recipes-571857357844 :- It check for compliance for read/write and also check if the logging is enabled on this bucket

Amazon Inspector
Example

AppwebSG :- Checks for security group allowing traffic in our case below are findings
Rule																			Severity	Failed
TCP port 5000 is reachable from the internet with active listener on instance	Low				1
TCP port 80 (HTTP) is reachable from the internet with no listener on instance	Informational	1


 3) AWS GuardDuty/AWS security Hub :- IAM Role,Bucket policy,CloudFormation Unsecured Orgin, LoadBalancer SGGroup
Example 

Guard Duty 
Example :- Monitors UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce access to EC2 instance.

Security Hub
This service takes inputs from AWS config,GurdDuty ,AWS inspector & Cloud Trail. 
Example 
AttackInstanceSG :- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
